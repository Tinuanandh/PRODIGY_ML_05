## Description

The project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately recognizing food items from images and estimating their calorie content.

 a model could empower users to track their dietary intake more effectively, make informed food choices, and achieve their health and fitness goals. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and regression algorithms for calorie estimation, the model seeks to provide users with a convenient and accessible tool for managing their nutrition

## Objectives:
- Download and extract Food 101 dataset.
- Understand dataset structure and files.
- Visualize random image from each of the 101 classes.
- Split the image data into train and test using train.txt and test.txt.
- Create a subset of data with few classes(3) - train_mini and test_mini for experimenting.
- Fine tune Inception Pretrained model using Food 101 dataset.
- Visualize accuracy and loss plots.
- Predicting classes for new images from internet.
- Scale up and fine tune Inceptionv3 model with 11 classes of data.
- Model Explainability.
- Summary of the things I tried.
- Further improvements.
- Feedback.
