## Description

The project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately recognizing food items from images and estimating their calorie content.

 a model could empower users to track their dietary intake more effectively, make informed food choices, and achieve their health and fitness goals. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and regression algorithms for calorie estimation, the model seeks to provide users with a convenient and accessible tool for managing their nutrition
